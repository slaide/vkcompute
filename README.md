# vkcompute

This is a project for a post-graduate course at Uppsala Univeristy.

The goal for this project is to implement a slime mold simulation, inspired by [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A).

This project is written in C++, and the simulation runs as compute shaders on a GPU, using the Vulkan API.
